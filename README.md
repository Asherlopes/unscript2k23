ML based project
Machine Learning Model to classify the documents readability (Very Good, Good, Bad, Very Bad) We have trained the model with features which are necessary to assess the quality of the document which are as follows: Noise, Blurriness, Vignetting, Clearness, Sharpness. We built various classification models such as Logistics, KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest. Random forest gave the best accuracy. We have used the flask framework for deploying the model and creating a website to upload the images/documents. And a php database for feedback submission on the website.
